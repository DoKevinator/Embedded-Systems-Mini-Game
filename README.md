# Embedded-Systems-Mini-Game
An embedded systems mini game project during my time at UCR. 

Spring quarter 2014. Under Professor Frank Vahid. Written purely in C. Took advantage of USART to maximize usability of dual microcontrollers. Used an RTOS-like system to cycle through different processes. RTOS-like system designed like a state machine, cycling through each process with a fixed duty cycle. Used interrupts to switch processes. Used many components such as resistors, LEDs, buttons, multiple microcontrollers, LCD display, voltage regulators, and potentiometers.
